   "content": "Why Common Core is Like Healthcare.gov Draw a bold line between this piece on the failure of the Common Core initiative to improve math education and the failure of healthcare.gov (even though the Common Core has nothing to do with IT): \"The inadequate implementation can make math reforms seem like the most absurd form of policy change.\" This is the sermon that + Mike Bracken \u00a0and + Jennifer Pahlka \u00a0have been preaching. \u00a0As Mike puts it, \"We don't have a policy crisis. We have a delivery crisis!\" \u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them. In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of healthcare.gov in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\u201d (See http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj ) In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\u00a0 \"The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....\" \"With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.\" By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \u00a0 \"In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \u201clesson study,\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\u2019s teachers.\" This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.\ufeff",

   "content": "+ Maria Konnikova 's NY Times article about the role of time and attention scarcity in the cycle of poverty was arresting and important. It really echoed some of the issues that we've seen at + Code for America \u00a0- there's a section at the end of the article that is going to be quoted often by people involved in the business of improving government services: \"If poverty is about time and mental bandwidth as well as money, how does this change how we combat its effects? 'When we think about programs for the poor, we don\u2019t ever think, hey, let\u2019s give them programs that don\u2019t use a lot of bandwidth,' says Mr. Mullainathan. Instead, we fault people for failing to sign up for programs that are ostensibly available, even though we don\u2019t factor in the time and cognitive capacity they need to get past even the first step. \u201c'If I give people a very complicated form, it\u2019s a big demand on cognitive capacity,' Mr. Shafir says. 'Take something like the Fafsa' \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 'Why is pickup for the low-income families less than 30 percent? People are already overwhelmed, and you go and give them an incredibly complicated form.' \"To him, the obvious conclusion is to radically change our thinking. 'Just like you wouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 to fill out a form, you shouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 in cognitive complexity,' he says. One study found that if you offer help with filling out the Fafsa form, pickup goes up significantly.\" It starts with empathy Jake Solomon has another take on the issue, which he explains so well in his post People, Not Data \u00a0 https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 about the work he and the other Code for America fellows in San Francisco did last year to simplify the compliance for Food Stamp recipients. \u00a0 What I love about Maria's article, though, is that it gives another way of thinking about why complex government forms are even worse than they appear, especially when it comes to providing services to people least able to deal with them.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"We don't need new policies. We need better implementation.\" Last night, I hosted Oakland City Councilor and mayoral candidate Libby Schaaf at a house party to introduce her to my neighbors. In response to a question about what to do about one of Oakland's many problems, she said \"We don't need new policies. \u00a0We need better implementation.\" \u00a0And in response to a question about disengaged city employees, she talked about the ones who really want to make a difference, and are just waiting to be activated. That resonated so strongly with me, because just the night before, I'd been at a talk by\u00a0 + Mikey Dickerson \u00a0about the healthcare.gov rescue effort, which sounded almost exactly the same notes. \u00a0It's easy to imagine heroic Silicon Valley coders riding to the rescue, but Mikey pointed out that they wrote very little code. \u00a0Much of the rescue work was done by the same people who built the broken site. \u00a0What the Silicon Valley team provided was clear management focus from people who knew what they were doing. They were able to debug all the bad process and broken communications between the various contractors who'd built the site, figure out what they needed from each of them, and then encourage and bring out the best in those people. They also had the guts and the force of will to get the recalcitrants on board. \u00a0(I wrote more about this at\u00a0 http://bit.ly/healthcare_rescue ) So much of the work we do at Code for America is drawn from the same playbook (though we usually don't have the kind of mandate that the \"Code Red\" healthcare.gov rescue team did!) \u00a0It's about debugging a process, making small tech interventions, but even more about helping \"the system\" to work better by understanding needs and figuring out why they aren't being met. \u00a0(See for example Jake Solomon's brilliant post about his work in San Francisco last year:\u00a0 https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 ) We have a constant parade of politicians who tell us what we want to hear: that they have a new policy idea, and that if we follow their advice, everything will be great. \u00a0This kind of \"magic bullet\" thinking is what gets us the same dismal results, over and over. \u00a0To be sure, there are times when we do need new policies, and I'm sure Libby has her share of policy ideas too. \u00a0But getting away from policy and digging into implementation is so important! So much of the problem isn't what we set out to do, it's how we do it. \u00a0I love hearing someone speak truth about that. P.S.\u00a0As a city councilor, Libby is in a non-executive role. \u00a0If she is in charge of actual implementation, I'm super-excited to see what she can do. \u00a0If you're an Oakland city resident, I hope you turn out and vote for her in November. \u00a0If you'd like to learn more, I'm co-hosting another, bigger event for Libby at the new (still under construction) BlueSprout Maker space in Oakland next Sunday. \u00a0Sign up to attend here: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/libbyraiser-tickets-11878702519 \ufeff",

   "content": "Great talk by Maciej Ceglowski. \u00a0Funny, smart, and with an important message. \u00a0Just like Maciej all around. \u00a0It is too long since I've spent time with him! I loved his thoughts on regulation, quoted below. \u00a0I don't agree with his initial statement that it should be \"illegal to collect\" certain kinds of data but do agree that it should be \"illegal to permanently store\" it. I think that's what he thinks too, if you read on beyond that first line. REGULATE It should be illegal to collect and permanently store most kinds of behavioral data. In the United States, they warn us the world will end if someone tries to regulate the Internet. But the net itself was born of a fairly good regulatory framework that made sure de facto net neutrality existed for decades, paid for basic research into protocols and software, cleared the way for business use of the internet, and encouraged the growth of the commercial web. It's good regulation, not lack of regulation, that kept the web healthy. \t Here's one idea for where to begin: 1. Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing\u2014your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you're using. It's very important that we regulate this at the database, not at the point of collection. People will always find creative ways to collect the data, and we shouldn't limit people's ability to do neat things with our data on the fly. But there should be strict limits on what you can save. 2. Limit how long they can keep it. Maybe three months, six months, three years. I don't really care, as long as it's not fifty years, or forever. Make the time scale for deleting behavioral data similar to the half-life of a typical Internet business. 3. Limit what they can share with third parties. This limit should also apply in the event of bankruptcy, or acquisition. Make people's data non-transferable without their consent. \t 4. Enforce the right to download. If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it. The EU already mandates this to some extent, but it's not evenly enforced. This rule is a little sneaky, because it will require backend changes on many sites. Personal data can pile up in all kinds of dark corners in your system if you're not concerned about protecting it. But it's a good rule, and easy to explain. You collect data about me? I get to see it. 5. Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups. \t 6. Give privacy policies teeth. Right now, privacy policies and terms of service can change at any time. They have no legal standing. For example, I would like to promise my users that I'll never run ads on my site and give that promise legal weight. That would be good marketing for me. Let's create a mechanism that allow this. 7. Let users opt-in if a site wants to make exceptions to these rules. If today's targeted advertising is so great, you should be able to persuade me to sign up for it. Persuade me! Convince me! Seduce me! You're supposed to be a master advertiser, for Christ's sake! 8. Make the protections apply to everyone, not just people in the same jurisdiction as the regulated site. It shouldn't matter what country someone is visiting your site from. Keep it a world-wide web.\ufeff",

   "content": "The Myth of the Spoiled Child There is an interesting op-ed in the NY Times by Alfie Cohn, who has written a new book, The Myth of the Spoiled Child . The article opens: \"THE conventional wisdom these days is that kids come by everything too easily \u2014 stickers, praise, A\u2019s, trophies. It\u2019s outrageous, we\u2019re told, that all kids on the field may get a thanks-for-playing token, in contrast to the good old days, when recognition was reserved for the conquering heroes. \"Children are said to be indulged and overcelebrated, spared from having to confront the full impact of their inadequacy. There are ringing declarations about the benefits of frustration and the need for grit. \"These themes are sounded with numbing regularity, yet those who sound them often adopt a self-congratulatory tone, as if it took extraordinary gumption to say pretty much what everyone else is saying. Indeed, this fundamentally conservative stance on children and parenting has become common even for people who are liberal on other issues.\" While I most certainly agree with the premise of the article, that unconditional love is best for kids, and that, as Cohn says: \"Over the last decade or so, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, and their colleagues in the United States and Belgium, have conducted a series of experiments whose consistent finding is that when children feel their parents\u2019 affection varies depending on the extent to which they are well behaved, self-controlled or impressive at school or sports, this promotes \u201cthe development of a fragile, contingent and unstable sense of self.\u201d' and \"Kids shouldn\u2019t be spared struggle and sacrifice, regardless of the effects. The second value is scarcity: the belief that excellence, by definition, is something that not everyone can attain. No matter how well a group of students performs, only a few should get A\u2019s. Otherwise we\u2019re sanctioning \u201cgrade inflation\u201d and mediocrity. To have high standards, there must always be losers. \"But it\u2019s the third conviction that really ties everything together: an endorsement of conditionality. Children ought never to receive something desirable \u2014 a sum of money, a trophy, a commendation \u2014 unless they\u2019ve done enough to merit it. They shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to feel good about themselves without being able to point to tangible accomplishments. In this view, we have a moral obligation to reward the deserving and, equally important, make sure the undeserving go conspicuously unrewarded.\" There is also something odd in the framing of the article, which comes across as a defense of all the faux rewards that are given in the name of self-esteem, when in fact, I think Cohn's whole career and his previous books (e.g. the classic Punished by Rewards ) emphasizes the downside of what is now called \"gamification\" and instead argues for intrinsic motivation. So it is important not to read this piece too quickly, but instead to think about what (I think) he is really saying: * Focus on giving your kids unconditional love, unblemished by either punishment or rewards * But don't be afraid of giving them encouragement * And don't buy into the idea that to be self-motivated, they need to get \"tough love.\" I know Cohn's thought is interesting and complex, and without knowing his previous work, I could easily see people being confused by what he was trying to say here, thinking that it is a defense of \"helicopter parents.\" \u00a0Which I don't think it is...\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "How to Raise Moral Children I thought this article on child-raising had a lot of good ideas in it. \u00a0There was stuff that was new to me, and stuff that was old, but the old stuff was worth reviewing, and the new research quite enlightening. Do read the article even if you don't have children.\u00a0The principles it outlines apply to our lives as adults as well, to leadership in the workplace and in the world. \u00a0And while I've reproduced many of the best bits below, it's well worth going to the article itself, because it is heavily linked to the original research. What matters most is not achievement but caring The article opened with the familiar advice that\u00a0\"when parents praise effort rather than ability, children develop a stronger work ethic and become more motivated.\" \u00a0But it went from there in a surprising direction: \"When people in 50 countries were asked to report their guiding principles in life, the value that mattered most was not achievement, but caring.\" Contrary to popular advice, praise of character is more effective than praise of behavior \"Many parents believe it\u2019s important to compliment the behavior, not the child \u2014 that way, the child learns to repeat the behavior. Indeed, I know one couple who are careful to say, 'That was such a helpful thing to do,' instead of, 'You\u2019re a helpful person.'\" But that's not what the research shows: \"...A couple of weeks later, when faced with more opportunities to give and share, the children were much more generous after their character had been praised than after their actions had been. Praising their character helped them internalize it as part of their identities. The children learned who they were from observing their own actions: I am a helpful person. This dovetails with new research led by the psychologist Christopher J. Bryan, who finds that for moral behaviors, nouns work better than verbs. To get 3- to 6-year-olds to help with a task, rather than inviting them 'to help,' it was 22 to 29 percent more effective to encourage them to 'be a helper.' Cheating was cut in half when instead of, 'Please don\u2019t cheat,' participants were told, 'Please don\u2019t be a cheater.' When our actions become a reflection of our character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices. Over time it can become part of us.\" I think this is an important insight. \u00a0Internalizing our experiences and making them part of our identity is a key element of growing up.\u00a0 Note: \u00a0\"by the time children turned 10, the differences between praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective. Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity.\" I will note that the advice for dealing with bad behavior (as opposed to good behavior) is just the opposite: \u00a0to emphasize the behavior, and not the character. \u00a0You don't want a kid to internalize the idea that he or she is a bad person! \u00a0That was the next key point, the distinction between guilt and shame. \"If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave.\" This is a fascinating distinction: \u00a0 \"When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions are interchangeable, research led by the psychologist June Price Tangney reveals that they have very different causes and consequences. \"Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it right.\" ... \"The most effective response to bad behavior is to express disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor Eisenberg and David R. Shaffer, parents raise caring children by expressing disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of empathy and responsibility for others, and a sense of moral identity, which are conducive to becoming a helpful person. The beauty of expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for improvement: 'You\u2019re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I know you can do better.'\" Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do. \"In a classic experiment, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140 elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game, which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty. They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or neither. The adult\u2019s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit. The words didn\u2019t make much difference \u2014 children gave fewer tokens after observing the adult\u2019s selfish actions, regardless of whether the adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was preached or not \u2014 they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm. Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.\" So true. \u00a0As I said above, all of this applies to adults too.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "Journalism vs. Punditry: NPR's Kelly McEvers on Why Reporting Matters There was a great segment on KQED Forum the other day with NPR correspondent Kelly McEvers. \u00a0Throughout the segment, she talked about the power of reporting. \u00a0She tells the story of when she was called to Bahrain for a government press conference about how all the protests were settled, and heard instead of how there was brutal crackdown going on in a nearby town that very day, rushed to the scene, and were able to report the substance rather than the government-controlled show. \u00a0 But perhaps the best moment comes at the end of the interview, reproduced below. \u00a0(It starts about about minute 47:48 in the audio file.) Caller : \u00a0I was in Syria too, and it really bothers me that people like you that have such a rare and important experience, that you don't give your own opinion. \u00a0For instance why President Obama... or criticize him for not getting rid of Assad like he got rid of Quaddafi. \u00a0And I know your editors and people try to control it and won't let you but I think you could do that now and maybe you could just give me your comments. \u00a0It must be very frustrating that you don't give your opinion on what should be done. \u00a0You just report a story. McEvers : \u00a0Well, guess what? \u00a0The people's opinions are much more valuable than my opinion. \u00a0Like I was just a conduit. \u00a0I'll never forget this one woman. \u00a0I was at a funeral in a village in rebel-controlled Syria and it was the first guy to die in this village. And I was on the women's side, with the mourning, and this woman looked at me and she \"Where is America? Where is Obama? \u00a0What? Syrian children aren't as good as Libyan children?\" \u00a0She said \"You know something? We're not going to forget this. We're not going to forget that you forgot about us.\" And all I had to do was report that line. I'm sorry but I feel like that's 10,000 times more powerful than me getting up like some TV pundit and spouting my opinion. That's who I am. I'm a journalist. That's my job.\" How right she is. \u00a0What you choose to report is, of course, an expression of your opinion. \u00a0But the power of doing it directly, with other people's voices, is profound. Being a channel for otherwise unheard voices that matter can be so much more effective than explicit editorializing. via + Jennifer Pahlka \u00a0\ufeff",

My conclusions: \u00a0\u00a0 Hats off to the rescue team. \u00a0They did a great service, while also demonstrating that yes, a small team with the right skills can do more than disorganized, mismanaged teams of contractors charging the government hundreds of millions of dollars. \u00a0But if we think that bringing Silicon Valley to the rescue is that simple, we're missing the big opportunity, which is to change the way we design and manage these projects.\u00a0 The lesson of the Code Red exercise wasn't that you can just sprinkle some Silicon Valley fairy dust and go back to business as usual. \u00a0The \"emergency measures\" of the rescue need to lead us to a profound rethinking of how government creates IT projects. At the same time, this is a long process, and we do need folks from Silicon Valley (and other tech hubs) to engage with it. \u00a0There's a lot to fix, and now is the time!\ufeff",

(The whole piece is long, but has many great moments. https://medium.com/p/e83510811c37 ): \"It\u2019s hard to watch the Olympics on TV in America because of the way they package it for Americans, trying to develop a sense that we are rooting for our country and making a connection to American athletes. So much is fabricated, and I wanted to see beyond that. I didn\u2019t come to root for TeamUSA, although I do care what Americans are doing and how American athletes are competing. But it is not why I came to Sochi. \"What I found special occurred surprisingly not at any of the events we went to, which included ski jumping, ice hockey and ice dancing, but took place two different times before a big screen TV inside the Adler transportation hub. We had just gotten off the train and there was a crowd of people looking up at the TV. All of them had stopped. The Russians were playing the US in curling, and the Americans had their last turn in a tie contest, as the stone went across the ice. It wasn\u2019t clear who won until one member of the Russian team raised his hands in celebration. Another day, the US was playing against Russia in hockey, and in the third period, the Russians scored a goal to tie the game. Both times, the crowd erupted in cheers, and a swelling of emotion that led to chanting \u201cRUS-SI-YA\u201d, \u201cRUS-SI-YA.\u201d http://youtu.be/zLvEtT2HcZM \"Something extraordinary was happening, and I realized that I shared their emotion, not because I rooted for the same team or same country, but I could ride the lifting emotion and energy, and its sudden appearance was something we all could enjoy. That was it, I thought at the time. That\u2019s what I came for.\"\ufeff",

The most obvious thing was not just that there were few Americans in the crowd, but few Europeans as well. The crowd was predominantly Russian tourists. This was an Olympics by and for the Russians. There was very little international character to the event.... \"Russia was on the stage, front and center, and even backstage. It was seen inside Russia as a triumph for Putin and the return of Russia to world prominence. It was also colorfully packaged as building the Russian brand for millions in a television audience watching from Europe and the US. Yet, as one American who had been to the Olympics in Vancouver said to me: \u201cThis is a somber Olympics.\u201d It was not a party for anyone but the Russians themselves, and they came from remote regions to get their pictures taken here, holding their own flag. Perhaps for them, like us, Sochi was a version of Russia that they had not seen before.\" Fascinating!\ufeff",

   "content": "Urban Office-steading in Brooklyn On Monday, I visited O'Reilly Media's small development office in Brooklyn, where Rune Madsen, Zach Schwartz, and Steve Klise\u00a0are working on our Atlas publishing tools (e.g.\u00a0 http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/ ). \u00a0They are holed up on the sixth floor of the old Pfizer Building on Flushing Avenue, with a spectacular view of the NY skyline. But what is most fun about the building is the way it is being developed. Rather than being a polished office building all ready for new tenants, it is being developed piecemeal in an exciting kind of urban reconstruction. After I had a look at the small office, we went on a tour of the vast undeveloped regions of the sixth floor, where rooms with mysterious purposes still remain, in skeletal form. \u00a0(Apparently, this was the area used to film the Green Goblin's lair in one of the Spider Man movies.) \u00a0In some areas, there are cinder block walls with holes knocked in them. \u00a0(Sadly, I somehow missed pictures of these.) Up on the eighth floor are a cluster of small food startups - pickles, bakeries, juice companies. \u00a0They apparently make the building a delight, because they sell lunch on many days.\u00a0 It struck me that this is a very different kind of redevelopment than I've seen in San Francisco. \u00a0Grittier, more frontier. I love it!\ufeff",

   "content": "I am somewhat appalled by the sloppy thinking of many of the Internet's latter-day critics. For example, in Joe Nocera's glowing review of Jaron Lanier's book, Who Owns The Future , I read: \"There are two additional components to Lanier\u2019s thesis.\u00a0The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \u201cjust one form of network efficiency.\u201d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier 'Kodak employed more than 140,000 people.' Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: 'When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.'\u201d Think about it for a minute. Was it really Instagram that replaced Kodak? Wasn't it actually Apple, Samsung, and the other smartphone makers who have replaced the camera? \u00a0And aren't there network providers, data centers, and equipment suppliers who provide the replacement for the film that Kodak once sold? Apple has 72,000 employees ( up from 10,000 in 2002. http://bit.ly/1lEY8HG ). Samsung has 270,000 employees. \u00a0Comcast has 126,000. And so on. Of course, there was a much larger ecosystem of people making money from photography in the Kodak era than those who worked for Kodak directly, but so too, the digital ecosystem is far larger than Lanier's silly example suggests. An economic ecosystem is a lot like an iceberg. Most of it is underwater. And shallow pronouncements like the one above do us all a disservice. I do agree with Jaron Lanier's key point, as reported by Nocera: \u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d\u00a0 I agree with that point - and have repeatedly warned about the risks. See for example, my 2007 observations about lessons from Wall Street for internet companies, Trading for Their Own Account ( http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html ), and my repeated urgings for companies to create more value than they capture ( http://bit.ly/1lF0d6y ). \u00a0But I don't actually believe that internet companies are hollowing out the economy, and I do believe that many of them do think about enriching their customers. \u00a0See for example Hal Varian's analysis of the economic impact of Google advertising ( http://www.google.com/economicimpact/ ) or my own analysis of the economic impact of the web hosting market on small business ( http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/open-source-small-business-report.html ). Contrast this with the damage to the economy done by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have truly worked to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers and the public, and the Internet gets a pretty good grade. The full story of the economic impact of digital networks has yet to unfold, let alone to be understood. \u00a0There is an awful lot of blind internet boosterism, but the latest round of critics seem even more wilfully blind than those they lambaste. For more nuanced, thoughtful reading on the impact of the internet, Nocera would do better to read books like + Ethan Zuckerman 's _ Rewire_ ( http://www.amazon.com/Rewire-Digital-Cosmopolitans-Age-Connection/dp/0393082830 ) or Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolffsson's Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age ( http://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies-ebook/dp/B00D97HPQI/ ).\ufeff",

I had heard scuttlebutt that the book was hostile to Amazon. \u00a0I didn't find that to be the case at all. In fact, it increased my admiration for Jeff and what he and his team have accomplished. After Steve Jobs died, everyone was saying \"Will we ever see his like again?\" \u00a0I would always respond, \"What do you mean? \u00a0He's already here, and his name is Jeff Bezos. \u00a0He's the only other tech entrepreneur I know who has transformed multiple industries, and shown the ability to work his magic not once but many times. \u00a0He's been the misunderstood underdog who came out on top because of vision, passion, and persistence.\" (OK, since then, Elon Musk has shown signs of pulling off the same ambition. But the fact remains that Jeff is one of the most important and successful entrepreneurs of our time.) Because of my admiration and liking for Jeff, \u00a0I was a bit dismayed to see the book position me as an \"adversary.\" \u00a0While in some ways I am a competitor to Amazon, I think of myself more as a partner and friend than any kind of adversary! \u00a0And while Jeff and I have occasionally butted heads, first about the 1-click patent back in 2000 (a conflict that ended up with us as friends), and later about some of Amazon's overly aggressive business tactics towards suppliers (described in chapter 10 of the book), and about the use of a proprietary DRM'd ebook format rather than open standards for the Kindle, I have always been a huge fan. One of the things the book gets across is what a great learner Jeff is. It makes clear just how freshly he responded to the challenges of growing his business, relying on some uncompromising principles but also adapting them so that, as long-time Amazon employee Rick Dalzell described, he always engaged his decision-making around \"the best truth at the time.\" (Chapter 9, page 267) His intense curiosity is one of the most striking things about him.\u00a0 The book also underplays Jeff's humanity, humor, and kindness. There are a lot of stories of how forceful, even abrasive, he sometimes is with subordinates - and I imagine that can be unpleasant. \u00a0But I also know just how hard it is to get thousands of people moving in the same direction without ruffling any feathers. And some of the changes that Jeff had to make to the company direction required enormous determination and force. I wish that some other leaders I know (e.g. in government) had equal clarity and determination. The book also really helped me see how deep Jeff's focus on the customer is. While I have always believed that focus to be sincere, I have also always worried that it would fade as the company became dominant, as is so often the case. \u00a0But the book makes clear again and again how it really is a touchstone for Jeff. I have also worried that focus on the customer isn't enough - that companies that become as powerful as Amazon also need to understand the complete ecosystem in which they operate. \u00a0The book's account of Amazon's sometimes brutal interactions with companies that it wanted to acquire, like Quidsi, the company behind diapers.com (page 298), and suppliers like German knife-maker Wusthof (page 300 and ff) makes clear that Amazon hasn't fully learned that lesson, and seems to believe that as long as customers benefit, it's ok to hurt suppliers. Sometimes that is true, when suppliers are inefficient or exploitive of their customers, but in other cases, squeezing all the profit out of suppliers' businesses is enormously short sighted. \u00a0The ideal ecosystem is one where everyone flourishes, not where one company flourishes at the expense of all the others. But I got a lot of hope from reading about Jeff's \"Amazon.love memo\" (Chapter 10, page 317-318), in which he analyzed why some big and powerful companies are hated, while others continue to engender love from not only their customers but their entire ecosystem. \u00a0In particular, I liked that one of the principles that Jeff distilled was this one: \"Capturing all the value only for the company is not cool.\" I've long urged companies to make \"Create more value than you capture\" their watchword, because it seems to me that building a healthy ecosystem in which everyone - employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and even competitors - can flourish is key to the positive impact that capitalism can have on society as a whole. \u00a0(See http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html ) The fact that Jeff is thinking about this as Amazon gets more dominant is a really good sign. \u00a0Some companies never realize that they need to be especially careful to create value for everyone as they get larger and more powerful.\u00a0 My chief beef about the book is that it skimped on some of the really big management lessons from Amazon. For me one of the most fascinating things about Amazon is the way that it seems to have modeled its organizational culture on its software. Stories I've heard about the way small teams are organized at Amazon remind me of the way modern modular software is designed. \u00a0I suspect that Amazon has cracked the code of the problem that was once laid out to me by the CIO of Fidelity Investments: \u00a0\"We know about all these new technologies. What we don't know is how to organize our company around them.\" \u00a0 In addition, I wish there were more written about the design of Amazon's internal services. When Jeff had the insight that led to the rise of Amazon as a platform - not only that its software needed to make the transition from a single monolithic application to a series of reusable web services, but also that those services should be designed in such a way that they could be re-used as easily by developers outside the company as by its internal units - he demonstrated a lesson that has yet to be learned by most large organizations. Take the recent healthcare.gov debacle. \u00a0One of the functions that the system depends on is income verification by the IRS. That lookup is, consistent with monolithic old-school software development, a tightly integrated part of the application rather than a true reusable service. If healthcare.gov were designed with the lessons of Amazon in mind, not only could the Federal healthcare.gov site call IRS web services to do income verification, but so could any of the state healthcare exchanges, or, for that matter, any private insurance company - or any company that needed to do income verification for any purpose. I realize that this is a general business book, and getting too deep on the technology might have scared off many readers, but I do hope that some future book about Amazon will give more than tantalizing glimpses of the interplay between the software architecture of a large-scale web enterprise like Amazon and the human and organizational architecture \u00a0that makes it possible for that software to be deployed in as agile a way as possible. I highly recommend this book. Amazon is one of the most important companies in the 21st century economy, and anyone whose business has been or will be touched by Amazon should be sure to read it.\ufeff",

   "content": "Google Teams Up with GM, Honda and Audi to Bring Android to Cars I'm intrigued but a bit skeptical about the newly announced initiative for an \"Open Automotive Alliance\" to bring Android to automobiles. \u00a0While I love the idea, there are two reasons I am reserving judgment: 1. The insatiable desire of vendors to \"differentiate\" on a standard platform, without thinking about what kinds of differentiation leads to real customer value. 2. The failure to understand that in today's world, it's not just about the software, but about data and services. This point is brought home to me every day by my Tesla Model S. While I love the car, I'm incredibly disappointed by its implementation of Google Maps (for which I paid an additional $3000 or so for the \"high tech package,\" without which navigation is disabled). The map display is awesome, especially the second turn-by-turn screen behind the steering wheel, and the directions are Google's. \u00a0But where does the traffic data come from? \u00a0Surely not from Google. \u00a0Any time I suspect there is traffic, I have to pull out my phone and use Google maps before I start, because Tesla's time estimates to destination are pathetically wrong. \u00a0Whatever data services they are using (or not using) to provide traffic estimates are completely useless. In short, I hope that automakers don't add bells and whistles to differentiate themselves, while neglecting core services that customers really depend on.\ufeff",

This is a management problem, and a cultural problem. The preferred method for implementing large technology projects in Washington is to write the plans up front, break them into increasingly detailed specifications, then build what the specifications call for. It\u2019s often called the waterfall method, because on a timeline the project cascades from planning, at the top left of the chart, down to implementation, on the bottom right. \"Like all organizational models, waterfall is mainly a theory of collaboration. By putting the most serious planning at the beginning, with subsequent work derived from the plan, the waterfall method amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work. Instead, waterfall insists that the participants will understand best how things should work before accumulating any real-world experience, and that planners will always know more than workers. \"This is a perfect fit for a culture that communicates in the deontic language of legislation. It is also a dreadful way to make new technology. If there is no room for learning by doing, early mistakes will resist correction. If the people with real technical knowledge can\u2019t deliver bad news up the chain, potential failures get embedded rather than uprooted as the work goes on.\"\ufeff",

But the aesthetic of the industrial internet always conjured up visions of connected devices that spoke quietly to each other: thermostats that never needed tending, plants that watered themselves and toasters that knew the day\u2019s weather. It was always a promise of convenience (and automation and sleekness). What wasn\u2019t obvious, to me anyway, was that an Internet of Things could usher in a golden age for curiosity. Where everyone, even a luddite like me, was constantly at the edge of what was possible. Where a new adventure \u2014 a new set of questions about our world and our place in it \u2014 was only a group friends and an internet connection away.\" Or as Stewart Brand said, in the memorable quote that opens the piece: \u201c[In] the last century, discovery was basically finding things.

   "content": "Why Government Investment Makes Sense Now I was interested to see what appears to be a Libertarian-leaning author making the case for government spending in the face of the current worldwide economic situation. \u00a0Frankly, I wish the US and Europe were investing a lot more in infrastructure right now, and putting idle resources to work on stuff that matters while credit is still cheap. \u00a0We'll still have to do that stuff later on, when it will be more expensive, because by then the government will be competing with the private sector for resources. From the article: \"Governments particularly in Britain and the Eurozone have attempted to fight depressed growth using austerity policies (in the context of expansionary monetary policy). The proponents of austerity theorise that by promising to bring down taxes and spending, they will unleash private sector spending by reducing future expectations of taxes. To me, this has always seemed like a boneheaded and Rube Goldberg-style approach. Simply, the issue of depressed private economic activity is far more complex than future taxation expectations. And aggressive monetary policy has not succeeded in reversing the depression (even if it has probably made the depression less severe). So it has been entirely unsurprising to me to see this approach largely failing. I approach the problem in a far more direct manner. The solution to lowered growth and elevated (and involuntary) unemployment is relatively simple.Eventually someone will start using up the idle resources. This will either be the private sector once it independently gets over its slump in animal spirits, or it will be the government. With such huge volumes of idle capital, interest rates will remain very low until stronger appetite for credit re-emerges. In equilibrium theory, the low cost of credit will by itself start to re-energise borrowing appetite by making more projects potentially profitable. Of course, interest rates are far from the only factor that borrowers take into account when seeking credit, and so it is perfectly plausible that the economy \u2014 as it has done \u2014 can remain depressed even with very low rates due to deleveraging pressures, low expectations and low confidence, etc. So if the market is ill-suited to taking up the idle resources any time soon \u2014 lying as it is in a depressive, irrational strop \u2014 the only agent that can do so is the state. The fact of low interest rates allows this to kill two birds with one stone \u2014 the state can borrow money (utilising idle capital) to create jobs (utilising idle labour), raising interest rates and bringing down the unemployment rate. And this approach does not require anyone to make accurate predictions about the future. It simply requires a market economy, and a state willing to employ idle resources when they are idle, and to ease off using idle resources when unemployment becomes low and interest rates start to rise. \"Many \u2014 including probably Hayek himself \u2014 would argue that using up idle resources in such a manner will not allow the structure of production to adjust to the new economic reality. The state, Hayek would argue is a poor allocator of capital because it lacks the informational efficiency of the market. I would mostly agree with Hayek\u2019s objection, and note that I favour a predominantly market-based economy. Government interventions should be kept to a necessary minimum. Yet, in a depressionary environment, the structure of production deteriorates as resources lie idle. Unemployed workers lose skills, lose competitive edge and spend and invest less, further depressing the economy. Capital \u2014 factories, buildings, amenities, ideas, etc \u2014 deteriorates. Young workers may enter the labour force but never find a job. Crime rises, and shady fringe businesses like loan sharks thrive as the unemployed struggle to pay the bills. The social costs of mass unemployment are exceedingly high. The adjustment occurring in a depression is more like a rot. And it is absurd to rot your way to growth. Instead, by lowering unemployment and using up idle capital (preferably in a mix of state-run infrastructure and technology projects, and lending to new businesses) more businesses can be born into existence. Potentially successful new ideas can be tried out, and may find success in the marketplace. The formerly unemployed get to develop skills, habits and ideas, instead of sitting at home all day doing nothing, or hunting for jobs in a scarce and depressed marketplace. And money will go into people\u2019s pockets, spurring investment and consumption, fomenting more new business growth. This, in my view, is the best shot at getting a depressed and rotten structure of production out of the doldrums and back toward strong organic growth. Sooner or later, of course, the private sector will come back and begin to use up resources. But that could be a very, very, very long way away. If we want the structure of production to adjust to the new world and to continue adjusting as the world continues to change, letting huge quantities of resources sitting idle seems like a bad way to do it. Targeted fiscal policy can change that.\ufeff",

In the anthology, contemporary authors were asked to reflect on documents from the time. Heaney chose a poem by British poet Edward Thomas, \"As the Team's Head Brass,\" which is also reproduced in the article. It is even more poignant than Heaney's commemoration of it. \u00a0Through a conversation with a farmer plowing a field, Thomas' poem reflects on the emptiness of Britain, whose men went off to war and never came back. \u00a0Thomas himself joined their ranks shortly after writing his poem, and died in France the following year. The poems \u00a0reminded me of the plaque on one of the columns in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that never fails to bring tears to my eyes when I visit it. \u00a0It reads: TO THE MEMORY OF ONE MILLION MEN OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918, AND OF WHOM THE GREATER PART REST IN FRANCE One million men! \u00a0And that's just the Brits, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Indians, and others from the British Empire. \u00a0Never mind the French, the Germans, and (in World War II, even more destructive though less pointless, the Jews, the Russians, and the Poles). It is good to remember that tumultuous time, and to reflect on how easy it is for things to go awry, for the human world to spin out of control into darkness. \u00a0But even more important, we can use this opportunity to reflect on\u00a0how little we have been asked to spend of our courage, our passion, and our lives confronting the great issues of our day.\ufeff",

   "content": "Ireland's School of Falconry One of the highlights of my family trip to Ireland in May was a visit to Ireland's School of Falconry at Ashford Castle in County Mayo ( http://www.falconry.ie/ ). We took a group lesson - with an age range from four to 86 - and as you can see, a splendid time was had by all. Our instructor and guide, Aurelia, was knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher. What was most astonishing to me is how lightly a falcon lands on your wrist. It's like a breath of air, so light and controlled that if your eyes were closed, you might not be sure it had happened. My pictures were mediocre, and so I didn't bother sharing them. These, which I just got from my fellow grandparents, Australian painter Pamela Griffith ( http://www.pamelagriffith.com/ ) and her husband Ross, are magnificent, and give a sense of what it's like. Be sure to see the picture of my grandson eye-to-eye with a falcon!\ufeff",

She is a wonderful actress. \u00a0(If you've seen either The Help or Fruitvale Station , you will recognize her from those movies, as she bookends both of them with her expressive supporting roles.) \"But it's the less-known actors who are more revelatory. Ahna O'Reilly (who dated Franco for years) is astonishing as Dewey, the only daughter, recalling Sissy Spacek's performance in Badlands. Jim Parrack was a perennial highlight of mine on True Blood, where he played golden-hearted good old boy Hoyt, and Franco's use of him here is absolute genius. He brings naturalism and genuine soulfulness to his portrayal of oldest brother Cash. Logan Marshall-Green is the handsome guy from Prometheus, but he'll always be Ryan's bad news brother Trey Atwood from The O.C. to me. He made me forget about Trey in this movie by sporting a beard and a sometimes indecipherable accent and reminding me of Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain.\"\ufeff",

It's what you do next,\" Clay said. \u00a0\"Wikipedia was Plan B.\" \u00a0 This talk - given to open government advocates - is particularly appropriate in the context of the current discussion about failures in government IT procurement. \u00a0After all, if you what you've specified is Nupedia, and the rules don't let you change your mind, you never get Wikipedia...\ufeff",

   "content": "I totally agree with +Nick Kristof's key point here, especially how he highlights media complicity in supporting the \"negotiation\" narrative. \u00a0I quote: \"In a household, husbands and wives disagree passionately about high-stakes issues like how to raise children. But normal people do not announce that if their spouse does not give in, they will break all the windows in the house. Hard-line House Republicans seem to think that their ability to inflict pain on 800,000 federal workers by furloughing them without pay gives them bargaining chips. The hard-liners apparently believe that their negotiating position is strengthened when they demonstrate that they can wreck American governance. The stakes rise as we approach the debt limit and the risk of default \u2014 which the Treasury Department notes could have an impact like that of the 2008 financial crisis and \u201chas the potential to be catastrophic.\u201d Astonishingly, Republican hard-liners see that potential catastrophe as a source of bargaining power in a game of extortion: We don\u2019t want anything to happen to this fine American economy as we approach the debt limit, so you\u2019d better meet our demands. In this situation, it strikes a false note for us as journalists to cover the crisis simply by quoting each side as blaming the other. That\u2019s a false equivalency.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "How Beautiful Interfaces Create Trust and Loyalty Reading Farhad Manjoo's recent article about Google's new commitment to design and the difference it is making, I was struck by the word \"beauty.\" \u00a0Steve Jobs' success at Apple made the word a key part of the strategic business lexicon, and now Google is executing on the beauty game plan. Government needs to learn the same lesson. In particular, I was struck by the parallels between Larry Page's pursuit of beauty in Google products and White House Deputy CTO Jennifer Pahlka's assertion that one of the best ways to restore faith in government is to create interfaces to government services that are simple, beautiful, and easy to use. (Jen is also the founder of Code for America.) From POLITICO's profile of Jen when she went to work for the the White House: \"Jennifer Pahlka thinks of a good government website as nothing less than a way to improve democracy. If the site is 'simple, beautiful and easy to use, you feel differently about government'\" ( http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/50-politicos-to-watch-jennifer-pahlka-94195.html#ixzz2g6FkSUcD ) From Manjoo's article: \"With the rise of sleek, portable touch-screen computers--i.e., the rise of Apple--people were now interacting with software in the same hands-on way they do with cars, clothes, appliances, and other physical goods. \"Our expectations of the real world began transferring to the virtual world,\" [lead designer for Google Search, Jon] Wiley says. Google's designers needed to address questions that they'd scarcely considered before: How do you feel when you use the product? Is it friendly, exciting, disorienting? Is it beautiful? \"The evidence suggested they weren't meeting those goals. In 2010, Google conducted a series of user tests to find out how people felt about Android. The results were stark: 'A lot of people felt that Android was essential to their lives, but they didn't like Android,' [Android Design Director Matias] Duarte says. The robust abilities of the OS 'made them feel small. It wasn't empowering, but daunting.' The same could be said for other Google products. When you loaded up something made by Google, you were more likely to feel overwhelmed than welcomed. \"Page took the two goals, beauty and cohesiveness, and combined them into a single mandate for designers: He called it 'One Beautiful Google.'\" And the results speak for themselves. \u00a0 I've often heard a similar notion from Jen -- that contemporary technology has raised the bar for government. When people can get information instantly on their smartphone, when companies like Amazon can have a product on your doorstep in less than a day, when these services are not only powerful but simple, beautiful, and easy to use, government looks even more like a bad bargain. If Barack Obama really wants to restore faith in government, and change the poisonous dialogue in Washington, he could do worse than pay attention to what Larry Page has done at Google, putting beauty and simplicity in government services at the heart of the legacy that his administration will leave the American people. Again, from Manjoo's article: \"While Page has never suggested a single design element, he was crucial to the redesign for the simple reason that he made it a firmwide priority. 'Only the CEO can get the entire company to focus on something,' says Wiley.\" Disclosure: Jen Pahlka is my fianc\u00e9, and I am on the board of Code for America.\ufeff",

   "content": "What I don't like about my Tesla Model S Everyone loves the Tesla Model S. \u00a0And I agree with most of the hype. It\u2019s a delightful car to drive, with a head-turning design, and all my worries about range have proven to be completely unnecessary. \u00a0(I do have the 85 battery.) \u00a0There are wonderful little grace notes, like the app that tracks the location of the car (which has already saved me once from losing my car in a vast airport parking lot, and let me decide that there was time to run back to the bathroom when being picked up at the airport.) The navigation system (with the tech package) is superb. I love that there\u2019s a small \u201cnext turn\u201d display right behind the steering wheel so you don\u2019t have to look over at the main screen. And the audio volume even goes to 11! :-) But it\u2019s not perfect. In the spirit of being helpful to the designers of future models, I thought I\u2019d list some things that I find less than perfect. \u00a0In no particular order: * If the door isn\u2019t completely shut, the car refuses to lock at all. This means that if your kid doesn\u2019t shut the door hard enough, and you walk away without looking, your car remains unlocked. The first time this happened, my car was rifled through during the night, and anything moveable was taken. * The control panel is so big and lovely, with so many options, that it is really dangerous until you spend the time to learn where everything is. You don\u2019t want to be looking for how to turn on the defroster when you are driving! \u00a0You need to figure out where all the commonly needed options are before you start. \u00a0Once you get used to it, it\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a little alarming at first. Take the time to train your eye and hand! * The bluetooth is flaky. (What bluetooth isn\u2019t?) At times, it works delightfully, automatically switching to my phone when I step into the car in the middle of a call. At worst, though, the entertainment system got totally wedged, thinking it was connected to Audible on my phone, and having that non-working display even overwrite maps and directions. I had to restart the display. (Hold down both buttons on the steering wheel till it reboots.) * The key, lovely as it is - an art object in itself - is designed in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to put on a key-ring with other keys (except with a cord rather than a ring.) * There is no spare tire. \u00a0This is probably OK, but it worries me. And I didn't realize it till I got the car home. Tesla should do a better job of making this clear, and what to do if you have a flat. (The car can't be towed, has to go on a flatbed truck.) * Visibility out the back is mediocre. * It gets pretty hot in the way back for kids in the kid seats. (This is a known problem, and they\u2019ve suggested workarounds.) * I miss the little sunglass holder up by the roof that was sported by our Prius. * I\u2019d love if the back-up display drew lines (like in modern sports events) to show me the location of the sides of the car relative to the display. The wide-angle lens takes some getting used to, the car seems wider than I\u2019m used to (not sure whether it is, but it feels that way) and I have a hard time telling how close the wheel is to the kerb or other obstacles. There are probably other things that nag me, but this list will do for now. Just a reminder that no one is perfect...\ufeff",

   "content": "+ Jennifer Pahlka \u00a0and I saw Fruitvale Station last night. ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334649/ ) It is a heartbreaking tale of race in America, based on the New Year's Day 2009 shooting of a handcuffed young black man by BART police at Fruitvale Station in Oakland, not far from where I now live. \u00a0The movie does a beautiful job of bringing the victim, Oscar Grant, to life. \u00a0His struggles, his aspirations, his loving family. \u00a0It brings home that there are real people on the other side of injustice, that it isn't something we should hate and in theory but ignore in fact. After the movie, Jen made the connection to a recent piece on Medium about white privilege that covered it from a very different point of view: the encouragement of disruption as a key element of Silicon Valley culture. \u00a0\"By teaching primarily young white men to unreflectively 'break things' and reward them when they do, Stanford and other Silicon Valley institutions like YCombinator are incubators not for any kind of social change or \u201cdisruption\u201d but for the assignment of privilege to the people who are most likely to already have it.\" The movie and the article are a powerful combination. P.S. Not relevant to the subject of this piece, but my niece Ahna O'Reilly has a small but pivotal role in the film. \u00a0She is the girl who meets Oscar in the market, and then later recognizes him on the train right before the incident that the movie commemorates. \u00a0Hers is the kind white face that shows the common humanity that we aspire to, as the angry police show what we become when we let ourselves be ruled by fear and anger.\ufeff",

A wonderful talk by Svante Myrick, 26 year old mayor of Ithaca NY. \u00a0I think my favorite moment is when he talks about a young black man being asked (mistakenly) if he was the Mayor, and how that changed how he felt about himself. He'd been mistaken for a lot of things - a mugger, someone to be scared of, but never someone to look up to, someone in authority. I also love how he tells the story of how many people helped him, and why the myth of the self-made man is destructive. \u00a0 + Jennifer Pahlka , who shared this with me, pulled out this quote:\u00a0 \"Why is it important to tell the story that way? What does it matter how we tell our stories? It matters because if we tell the stories the correct way, we get the correct moral from those stories. And when we tell them the wrong way, the way we\u2019ve been telling them for too wrong in this country -- the story of self-made men and great men and women of history -- we\u2019re get the wrong morals, and from the wrong morals we take the wrong actions.\"\ufeff",

I have found 10,000 things that do not work.\" I found the original source (and what appears to be a good snopes-like site for investigating quotes, quote-investigator.com . Here's how the story actually goes (and it's even better, albeit a little longer), as told by one of Edison's long time associates, Walter S. Mallory: \"I found him at a bench about three feet wide and twelve to fifteen feet long, on which there were hundreds of little test cells that had been made up by his corps of chemists and experimenters. He was seated at this bench testing, figuring, and planning. I then learned that he had thus made over nine thousand experiments in trying to devise this new type of storage battery, but had not produced a single thing that promised to solve the question. In view of this immense amount of thought and labor, my sympathy got the better of my judgment, and I said: \u2018Isn\u2019t it a shame that with the tremendous amount of work you have done you haven\u2019t been able to get any results?\u2019 Edison turned on me like a flash, and with a smile replied: \u2018Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results! I know several thousand things that won\u2019t work.\u2019\" The \"ten thousand\" formulation first appears in 1982. You'll notice also that the comment was not made about the light bulb, but about batteries.\ufeff",

What I'd really like is a drag and drop interface like storify uses for tweets, where you can drag in photos, with a blank caption area above and below. \u00a0It would be really sweet. \u00a0 Click through the link below and you'll see what I mean. \u00a0Contrast this with my attempt to achieve the same effect in Google+ at either\u00a0 https://plus.google.com/103414305538705963461/posts/QQ55mdnJFzv (West Maroon Trail: Aspen to Crested Butte: see note below about why this post isn't directly from me, but is someone else's re-share of it!) or https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/6yqvvicharS (The War Memorial of Korea) What would be ideal would be for the user to toggle between either the stream view or the album view. \u00a0I understand why Google likes the album view, but sometimes you want to tell a story in pictures. (There's another serious problem with photo handling in Google+: \u00a0I published both of these posts publicly, only to discover later that they had been deleted somehow by Google. \u00a0Fortunately, I had written up the War Memorial of Korea post on the plane, in a text file to accompany the pictures, so I could recreate it a year later. And someone had re-shared my Maroon Bells post, and that survived even though Google lost the original. But there's something odd here, a bug I reported but that no one seems to have figured out. \u00a0(I originally discovered it on the War Memorial post, but just discovered it again on the Maroon Bells post when I googled for it just now, and could only find the re-share, with a note that my original post had been deleted. \u00a0I can assure you it wasn't deleted by me!))\ufeff",

   "content": "I love the idea here that there are three capitalisms, \"Yeoman Capitalism\", \"Corporate Capitalism\", and \"Supercapitalism,\" but I'm not sure I agree entirely with Michael O. Church's description of each of them. \u00a0 His description of Yeoman Capitalism is pretty good - this is the capitalism that Adam Smith wrote about, and it is indeed governed by an invisible hand. When companies are engaged in providing real goods and services to each other, and make money by satisfying the needs of others, capitalism works really well. I like to think that O'Reilly is a great example of Yeoman Capitalism. We make our money by providing things that people pay us for, and I like to think we've created more value for society than we've captured for ourselves, which is how I think it ought to be. \u00a0(There is many a multi-billion dollar company whose founders told me they started with a couple of O'Reilly books.) But it's not just small companies that can practice this kind of capitalism. The corporate structure and the \"joint stock company\" was a great invention: \u00a0a way to allocate resources for larger scale initiatives. \u00a0And there are still companies that use capital markets this way. \u00a0Amazon is a great example: \u00a0they have raised huge amounts of capital from financial markets and have used it to transform industries, providing huge amounts of consumer value in the process. Unlike, say Google, which was profitable without needing huge amounts of outside capital, Amazon has only been able to accomplish what is has with the aid of capital markets. I think many big companies start out this way, and only go wrong later in their lifecycle, when they are established, and their focus changes from innovation to preservation. \u00a0And that's where we get to Church's \"Corporate Capitalism.\" Church describes Corporate Capitalism as a kind of Feudalism, one in which the corporation is primarily concerned with self preservation and the perquisites of its executives, and co-opts government to give it unfair advantage. \u00a0That is entirely true,\u00a0but he doesn't explain how it came to be so. \u00a0 Where this went off the rails was with the increased financialization of corporations. \u00a0There are at least three problems with this: 1. Companies are often prevented from the market from taking risks and trying new things. \u00a0(Amazon is a stellar exception.) \u00a0I remember one entrepreneur telling me: \u00a0\"I can't do what I need to do to save my company. We're sitting on too much cash. If I invest in the future as I need to, it will depress the stock price, and we'll get acquired for our cash.\" \u00a0That was exactly what happened. \u00a0The company is no more. 2. Things that serve real human needs but take too long to show financial results are abandoned. We see diseases that could be cured, but aren't, because there isn't enough money in it. \u00a0We see workers squeezed out to plump up profits, or not paid a living wage. (See\u00a0 http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2013/07/18/why-mcdonalds-employee-budget-has-everyone-up-in-arms/ )\u00a0 3. \u00a0Rather than being paid out of the actual earnings of the corporation, executives are largely rewarded based on the stock price. This leads both to outsized gains to executives, but also to a culture of manipulation of those prices, whether or not they are justified by the creation of real marketplace value. \u00a0And that, of course, is the basis for \"supercapitalism.\" Supercapitalism is the capitalism that brought us the mortgage crisis of 2009, the result of banks creating and selling financial instruments that were designed to fail. \u00a0It also brings news of recent shenanigans like Goldman Sachs' manipulation of commodities markets. (See\u00a0 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all ) There's a better term for this: \u00a0Looting, as described in a 1996 paper by George Akerlof and Paul Romer: \"\u2026the normal economics of maximizing economic value is replaced by the topsy-turvy economics of maximizing current extractable value, which tends to drive the firm's economic net worth deeply negative. Once owners have decided they can extract more from a firm by maximizing their present take, any action that allows them to extract more currently will be attractive--even if it causes a large reduction in the true economic net worth of the firm. \u00a0A dollar in increased dividends today is worth a dollar to owners, but a dollar in increased future earnings is worth nothing because future payments accrue to the creditors who will be left holding the bag.\"\u00a0 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162 That's supercapitalism in a nutshell.\u00a0\ufeff",

   "content": "This New Yorker piece by Atul Gawande has buried in it the solution to our under-employment crisis: stop focusing on financial outcomes for companies, and start focusing on results that make a better world. There are several accounts of extremely labor-intensive projects that have saved millions of lives (training in Bangladesh about how to treat cholera, given door-to-door, and a similar project in Uttar Pradesh to help counter infant mortality.) Gawande puts these projects in historical context by talking about how hard it was for the world to embrace hospital cleanliness as a life-saver, and the costs involved: \"Reactions that I\u2019ve heard both abroad and at home have been interestingly divided. The most common objection is that, even if it works, this kind of one-on-one, on-site mentoring \u201cisn\u2019t scalable.\u201d But that\u2019s one thing it surely is. If the intervention saves as many mothers and newborns as we\u2019re hoping\u2014about a thousand lives in the course of a year at the target hospitals\u2014then all that need be done is to hire and develop similar cadres of childbirth-improvement workers for other places around the country and potentially the world. To many people, that doesn\u2019t sound like much of a solution. It would require broad mobilization, substantial expense, and perhaps even the development of a new profession. But, to combat the many antisepsis-like problems in the world, that\u2019s exactly what has worked. Think about the creation of anesthesiology: it meant doubling the number of doctors in every operation, and we went ahead and did so. To reduce illiteracy, countries, starting with our own, built schools, trained professional teachers, and made education free and compulsory for all children. To improve farming, governments have sent hundreds of thousands of agriculture extension agents to visit farmers across America and every corner of the world and teach them up-to-date methods for increasing their crop yields. Such programs have been extraordinarily effective. They have cut the global illiteracy rate from one in three adults in 1970 to one in six today, and helped give us a Green Revolution that saved more than a billion people from starvation.\" It seems to me that rediscovering the kinds of tasks that require investing human capital to make real change are exactly the kinds of things we need to focus our economic energies on. Money and labor should follow the things that need doing, not be an end in itself, as it is so often in our distorted economy.\ufeff",

I was particularly pleased to see Hy Minsky, my friend Bill Janeway's one time intellectual mentor, singled out for prescience. Minsky's ideas were applied to the Great Moderation in a 1995 paper by Steve Keen: From the NYT article: \"He suggested that lending standards would be gradually reduced, and asset prices would rise, as confidence grew that \u201cthe future is assured, and therefore that most investments will succeed.\u201d Eventually, the income-earning ability of an asset would seem less important than the expected capital gains. Buyers would pay high prices and finance their purchases with ever-rising amounts of debt. \"When something went wrong, an immediate need for liquidity would cause financiers to try to sell assets immediately. 'The asset market becomes flooded,' Mr. Keen wrote, 'and the euphoria becomes a panic, the boom becomes a slump.' Minsky argued that could end without disaster, if inflation bailed everyone out. But if it happened in a period of low inflation, it could feed upon itself and lead to depression. \u201c'The chaotic dynamics explored in this paper,' Mr. Keen concluded, 'should warn us against accepting a period of relative tranquillity in a capitalist economy as anything other than a lull before the storm.'\u201d\ufeff",

There are few applications of any significance that do not have a big data back in running in the cloud and those clouds data center apps need someone to run them. I have long thought that one of the big differences between modern applications and those that existed in the PC era is that in some fundamental sense the applications of today still have the programmers inside of them, continuously updating them, managing the data, and performing other critical factors in their operation. This is true of so many mobile apps, which appear to be operating simply on the handheld device but are actually operating in the space between the device and the data center. The series of videos that we are working on with Etsy for Ops School are an introduction to the skill set of the people who keep those applications running. This is also the focus of our Velocity Conference.\ufeff",

At Google, 'you need to engage people not just as subjects, but as experimenters.'\u201d This is an important insight.

The salt mines at Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, near the Austrian border:\u00a0 http://bit.ly/126IhnL The photos here don't do it justice (and I visited it before the days of digital cameras, so I don't have any of my own to share.) \u00a0It brought to life Tolkien's Mines of Moria - vast underground chambers a kilometer under a mountain, with the remnants of ancient wooden mine works. \u00a0The images from Tolkien fed the real life experience, and the real life experience clothed the images from Tolkien. \u00a0 2. The Accelerator at CERN:\u00a0 http://bit.ly/11jAEPC Modern and high-tech rather than ancient and dusty, but also redolent with cultural imagery, this time from James Bond movies. \u00a0(Was it Thunderball that had a similar setting?) 3. \u00a0The Titan Missile Museum in Green Valley, AZ:\u00a0 http://bit.ly/13UAIDD A taste of cold war history in one of the few preserved underground missile silos. \u00a0(I also went to a similar missile silo in Wyoming when I was a kid. \u00a0It was still operational. \u00a0I'm not sure how my uncle swung it, but it was an amazing experience. Why am I telling you this? \u00a0These photos of NYC's subway project brought to mind elements of all three. \u00a0And boy, do I wish there were a tour! It's so easy to take for granted the amazing infrastructure of our civilization, and the people and tools that it takes to build it. There should be more opportunities to see things like this in the making, and from the underside, as they are operating!\ufeff",

   "content": "Why Silicon Valley is not the second coming of the Gilded Age. I love + Steven Johnson 's rebuttal of George Packer's piece in the New \u00a0Yorker, which repeats the tired refrain about Silicon Valley solutionism and the bizarre notion that Silicon Valley is dominated by Randian libertarians. (I think Johnson is absolutely right in his definition of a new kind of political persuasion, which he calls the \"Peer Progressive\", and describes beautifully in his new book Future Perfect . In this piece, I particularly liked Johnson's take on wealth creation in Silicon Valley. \u00a0While Packer decries the tens of thousands of millionaires as creating a new upper class, Johnson points out something more profound and important: \"Then there\u2019s the issue of inequality, which is where Packer starts, observing the rise of homelessness and the staggering cost of real estate in the area. No doubt about it, the explosive rise in wealth and income inequality in the U.S. may well be the single most pressing problem that we face, the slow but steady reversal of the last century\u2019s rising tide. Packer deserves serious props for shining a light on that disturbing trend. But here again, I think he gets the Silicon Valley part of the story wrong, even if his motives are in the right place. Early in the piece, he cites a telling statistic: \u201cThere are fifty or so billionaires and tens of thousands of millionaires in Silicon Valley.\u201d Think about that for a second: tens of thousands of millionaires, almost all them created by companies that didn\u2019t exist two decades ago. \"Why did that happen? Sure, companies went public or sold for staggering sums, but companies have been going public or selling out for generations without creating tens of thousands of millionaires along the way. The defining difference between Silicon Valley companies and almost every other industry in the U.S. is the virtually universal practice among tech companies of distributing meaningful equity (usually in the form of stock options) to ordinary employees. Before companies like Fairchild and Hewlett-Packard began the practice fifty years ago, distributing stock options to anyone other than top management was virtually unheard of. But the engineering tradition that spawned Silicon Valley was much more egalitarian than traditional corporate culture. There\u2019s a great book on this topic, called In The Company Of Owners , that documents just how distinct the Valley is from the rest of U.S. corporate culture. The top 100 tech companies granted 19% of their total ownership to non-senior-executive employees (i.e., everyone excluding the CEO and four lieutenants.) For the rest of corporate America, that number was 2%. In other words, when it came time to share rewards with ordinary employees, the Tech 100 were ten times more generous than low-tech firms. This is actually one of the hidden strengths of the tech sector in the US: its companies are much more competitive precisely because they are much more egalitarian in how they share their wealth internally. I would be surprised if there were any new industry in the history of capitalism that distributed its economic rewards to its employees as widely as Silicon Valley has. Billionaire founders or CEOs are nothing new. But multi-millionaire middle-managers? That\u2019s something else altogether. \"This is the paradox that Packer elides with his New Gilded Age narrative.... \"For Packer, the lesson seems to be: the excesses of the digital-era super rich give us a case study in the growing problem of inequality throughout the U.S.. But you could reasonably draw the exact opposite lesson: that one way to deal with rising inequality is to make the rest of corporate America act more like Silicon Valley.\" I totally agree. The reason we have lost the middle class is because workers don't share in the success. \u00a0Supposedly, it goes to the shareholders, but the dirty secret is that much of the gain goes to the management. \u00a0A great book on the topic is Lynn Stout's The Shareholder Value Myth .\ufeff",

But I also found fascinating the observation about walking as a social value embodied in the British landscape (vs. the ubiquitous car-only culture of America). \u00a0Dominique Browning writes: \"Our walk along the Wales coast got me thinking about how we build our landscapes around various cultures. In the United States, the car culture dominates. Of course we have miles of hiking trails in our national parks, but we don\u2019t have walks connecting towns and cities. Instead, we engineer marvelous highway systems that twist and wind along breathtaking vistas. Think of gorgeous Route 1 along the coast of Northern California, or the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway in the southeast \u2014 or for that matter, the West Side Highway in Manhattan, hogging the view of the mighty Hudson. If I wanted to walk from my coastal Rhode Island town to, say, the charming village of Padanaram, Mass., a mere 15 miles away, I would have to stick to asphalt \u2014 without even the safety of sidewalks. \"But in Britain, there is a disposition toward walking. The land is crisscrossed with trails that connect villages, and every day, no matter what the weather, people young and old are out walking. In Wales, the needs of landowners and farmers \u2014 for privacy, or for keeping animals penned in \u2014 have been balanced against the need for citizens to tromp through private property.\" Food for thought.\ufeff",

   "content": "Freedom is not Free: Photos and Reflections on The War Memorial of Korea Last year, I was in Korea shortly before Memorial Day. \u00a0I posted a photo album of the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, and for some reason, Google+ deleted the post the next day. I decided to wait till Memorial Day this year to repost. Far and away the most interesting tourist destination I went to in Seoul was the War Memorial. I found it moving and beautiful. It is grandiose in its emotion, thought provoking in its storytelling, humbling in its national pride. It's hard not to look at this monumental sculpture with skyscrapers in the background, in the heart of a bustling modern city, while a mere 30 miles away, people live in abject poverty without enough to eat, under the thumb of a dictatorship that, sixty years ago tried to extend its reach over the entire peninsula. \u00a0If the people of South Korea hadn't fought back, if the US and the 20 other nations that made up the UN forces in support of South Korea hadn't joined in the fight, this entire country, one of the most advanced in the world today, wouldn't exist. \u00a0The people have reason to be proud. It's easy to be critical of the military in this era of American wars that ask no sacrifice from the general public (they are simply put on the national credit card, to be paid by future generations) and thus face no test of public assent to whether they are necessary or truly justified. \u00a0And so it's easy to forget that there is a time when you do have to stand and fight. \u00a0 I have always had a soft spot for tales of valor. My kids used to laugh at me because I'd tear up telling them the story of the Battle of Britain, or Thermopylae, or the Siege of Malta. \u00a0The Korean War was not really on my radar till now. \u00a0Now, I'm hungry for the stories. I loved the caption on the monumental bronze sculptures outside the Memorial building: \u00a0Freedom is not Free. It seems appropriate to post these photos on Memorial Day, the holiday on which we in the USA give thanks to those who paid the price. One part of the monument, depicting the reunification on the battlefield of two brothers, one fighting for South Korea, the other for the North, is also extraordinarily moving. \u00a0The crack symbolizes the broken nation that they hope will one day be healed. Perhaps most stunning of all is the chapel, if I can call it that, at the heart of the monument. A beam of light falls from the top of a dome 20 or 30 meters up, illuminating the water in a massive bowl, overflowing in a constant stream. \u00a0Photos can't do it justice. \u00a0It is truly magical. I had the great good fortune to have the room to myself for ten or fifteen minutes of meditation, before a crowd of schoolchildren shattered the timelessness of the place. \u00a0 This is a wonderful place for children, closer to Disneyland than to a normal museum. There are wonderful life-size dioramas of the hard life during the war. \u00a0Outside there are planes and tanks and ships to climb on. In the basement, there are records of other wars - the long medieval wars against various Chinese empires, the Mongolians, the Japanese. Models of ships and Korean knights on horseback and castles. \u00a0 The exhibits are sparse, with most of the information provided by video rather than text (and none of it in English.) There is less focus on facts than in a typical museum, and much more on a sense of national pride. In fact, it really isn't a museum, though it serves as one. \u00a0It is a shrine to those who gave their lives that this country might exist, a thank you, a place of honor and memory. #MemorialDay \ufeff",

The Tesla experience is very similar to what you experience in an Apple Store: so much better than the normal retail experience. \u00a0Should there also have been laws to protect Circuit City and Best Buy from Apple's direct to consumer model?\ufeff",

   "content": "The day before yesterday, on my Irish family holiday, my mother and daughter and I visited Fota House, an old estate near Cork. We only had time for the tour of the downstairs (though we did manage a peek into the dining room.) Note the hidden door from the dining room to the servants' corridor, complete with plaster. The reason for sharing publicly is to correct some of the impressions from Downton Abbey. First off - there are far too few servants at Downton. The staff at Fota, for a family of four, was about twenty, with another thirty or forty to handle the grounds. The kitchen must have been terribly hot! There were four different ovens, a giant roasting spit, and three giant charcoal fired burners for pots. There were separate staircases for the female staff and the male staff, so they wouldn't have occasion to fraternize on the stairs. The scullery was typically separate from the kitchen, since otherwise steam from the washing would spoil the food. The scullery sink was unusually low, because it was typically a young girl, not fully grown, who washed dishes and clothes from before dawn till evening. On the other hand, footmen were selected for height, and the taller they were, the more they were paid. There were a few other interesting tidbits: In Ireland, the Butler, the Housekeeper, and the Cook would all have been Protestant. Only the lower servants would have been Catholic. As in Downton, the cook had a privileged position, and it was a rare master or mistress who argued with whatever the cook provided. There was an account of one of the ladies of Fota who did argue with her cook, and it was considered quite a phenomenon! Pilferage by servants was a concern (at least in Ireland). There was a story of one housekeeper who made the servants whistle all the way from the kitchen so that they couldn't eat any tidbits from the plates on the way to the dining room! The estate was so large that it now includes a wild animal park (effectively, a zoo, with the animals having lots of room to range free), an arboretum, and the house, originally built in the 1820s on the site of a much earlier hunting lodge belonging to the same family. Surprisingly, the house was still occupied in the old style until 1975! The lady of the house was still being served breakfast by a butler in full dress within the lifetime of many of us. So Downton Abbey is not as distant as it might have appeared. Of course, at the time of Downton Abbey, there were far more servants. I was surprised to learn that in 1911, \"domestic service\" was the second largest source of employment in the UK. \ufeff",

This was the story of the PC, of the web, and now of the smartphone era. \u00a0 Government too can act as a platform provider - but for society as a whole. Think the Interstate Highway System in the US, weather satellites, or the way the opening up of the GPS system for private use enabled everything from in-car navigation to Foursquare. Open data is to the 21st century as the highway system was to the 20th. Today, President Obama issued an executive order that will put more fuel on the open data fire.\ufeff",

   "content": "I just got my Google Glass last night, and it's been a long time since a tech gadget has had me grinning ear to ear so often. I was at the #tech4dem \u00a0event, and let + Marci Harris \u00a0and + Macon Phillips \u00a0try on my Glass. Both of them quickly got the same big grin! It's not at all what people expect! \u00a0It's a magical experience. \u00a0I haven't yet been quite able to put my finger on why it feels that way, but I think it's the immediacy. Rather than fumbling for your phone, then opening the camera app, you can take a picture or a video with a touch, and share it with another touch. You can also talk to the device, taking pictures, doing google searches, getting directions, or sending emails or texts, without ever touching the devices. (You can wake it up with a touch or by tossing your head slightly.) A couple of comments: 1. People have this notion that it's privacy-invading. \u00a0It really isn't. It's pretty easy for people you're interacting with to see when the device is on - the lit-up screen is viewable from the other side. \u00a0Yes, you can quickly take a photo or video, but only with either \u00a0a voice command, or a push of a button on the frame, so it's clearly noticeable.\u00a0 2. People also have the notion that you won't be able to tell when someone is talking to you and when they are on the device. Again, that's just not true. It sits above your eyes and it's very clear when someone is looking up at the screen rather than looking at you. 3.\u00a0Speech is the natural interface for this device, but there are also a lot of gestures on the frame that control it. \u00a0It's elegant and intuitive. But some of the magic is the immediacy of talking to it, or touching it, and having something happen. So far, there's a lot that's still buggy, so it isn't ready for consumer adoption. For example, it is supposed to integrate with your contacts, so you can text and email contacts from the device, but so far, I've found it not integrating well with my contacts. \u00a0It picks the first phone number from the contact, rather than looking at the field that says \"mobile,\" and there isn't an easy way to change that. And when I edited the contact (something the management app lets you do), the edited contact doesn't appear to sync with Glass. \u00a0So there's a lot more integration to do. On the other hand, photos seamlessly upload into G+ along with the stream from your phone. \u00a0Photos and videos are remarkably good.\ufeff",

   "content": "\"What the dead don't know piles up, though we don't notice it at first.\" Brilliant elegy for his wife by New Yorker writer Roger Angell. Unfortunately, the so-called \"digital edition\" makes it almost impossible to read this online, at least on my laptop. \u00a0And it makes it even more difficult to share enough in the way of tidbits to encourage you to read it. But trust me, it was a lovely piece, about how history passes the dead by, and how what \"they don't know\" puts them further and further away from us over time. \u00a0This is beautifully written, deeply moving, and expands how you see the world in the way that only the best writing can. A good argument for subscribing to _The New Yorke_r in print, and keeping old copies around. \u00a0(This one was from last November.)\ufeff",

This is the command console from the Apollo spacecraft . Today, our computers are sleeker and more powerful, but our aim is set much lower. What an inspiration the \"Mercury 7\" were when I was a child; as a teenager, how I thrilled to the grainy telecast of those first steps on the moon! I never dreamed it would take us so long to get back. I'm really delighted by the initiative of entrepreneurs like +***** of SpaceX, and +Edward Lu of the B612 Foundation, who are taking us back to space with big dreams, but I also have to lament that we seem to have lost the shared will to greatness. As I've often said (echoing, unknowingly until recently, Abraham Lincoln), government is a means of collective action, of doing things that are too ambitious for individuals and even big companies. Our space program was such a big, shared initiative. And I miss it. In our focus on \"small government\", we've also embraced small dreams, and no longer seem willing to make big bets on the future. The work of Elon and others was made possible by big investments that we made in this age when computers were the size of washing machines, and had less power than our disposables. It was our courage and will and our dreams that made the difference."

   "content": "Crushing national debts, economic revolutions, and extraordinary popular delusions I just came across this fabulous paper by Andrew Odlyzko, which opens as follows: \"A superpower with crippling debt, exorbitant taxes, glaring inequality, wages far exceeding those of competitors, high and persistent unemployment, lack of basic workplace skills, malnutrition, a rapidly growing rival across the ocean to the West, heated debates about the role of government in the economy, and widespread pessimism about the future. Could that be any country but the U.S. today, with China as the looming threat? Toss in costly military misadventures in the Middle East, Greece unable to pay its debts, a sclerotic domestic legal system clogging up the economy, and the rising competitor \ufb02outing copyright and other property rights and relying on slave labor, and the case seems clinched. Yet this is also an accurate description of Britain around 1850, with the United States as the transatlantic rival. Surprisingly, what followed was an explosive acceleration of the Industrial Revolution that saw the UK sprint ahead of others during the \u201cGreat Victorian Boom\u201d of the third quarter of the 19th century.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "Reinventing Regulation I'm doing a Google+ Hangout next week (April 23, 11 am PT) on a subject that I've been thinking about for a while: how should government regulation be updated for the 21st century? \u00a0Regulation has a bad name, largely because it is so easy to think of so many examples where it's done badly. When regulatory systems work, we take them for granted. For example, without the \"regulation\" imposed by anti-spam efforts on the net, email would be unusable, search results would be useless, and reasonable discussions on blogs and other online forums impossible. Without the regulatory efforts of credit card fraud detection, e-commerce would be impossible. Without the regulatory efforts of the fuel injection system in your car, the traffic control system on a subway system, or the autopilot in an aircraft, transportation would be reduced to a crawl. Each of these positive regulatory examples teaches us something about how to reinvent government regulation. \u00a0That's a topic I'll be exploring in conversation with + Matt Cutts \u00a0of the Google Search team, Sophie Raseman of the US Department of Treasury, and +Brandon Ballinger, the co-founder of Sift Science, an anti-fraud internet startup. (It's also worth thinking about how Amazon ratings, eBay reputation, NetFlix recommendations, Yelp reviews, and other reputation systems are also examples of regulatory systems that can potentially replace, augment, or transform our notion of the regulator as gatekeeper or policeman into a notion of a system that helps us get where we want to go.) I don't have answers. I do have questions. I'm hoping that I can get a whole lot of people, both inside and outside government, thinking with me.\ufeff",

I always substitute hazelnut flour for oats, but the loaf you ate today had half a cup of buckwheat flour to 2.5 cups of hazelnut flour. The fun thing is you can switch up whatever kinds of nuts and seeds you want as well.\" I just set one going this morning. \u00a0I did use the oats, but did substitute some hazelnut flour. \u00a0I also added raisins and half a chopped orange (that trick from my old friend George Wright.)

And right now, the walk from the Jefferson Memorial around to the Martin Luther King Memorial, passing through the FDR Memorial, is awash in blossoms. The traffic, however, is arduous. Don't try to get to the normal parking near the Jefferson Memorial. Park on city streets over in Foggy Bottom if you can, and walk from there, starting at the MLK end. It's a longer walk, but less time overall.\ufeff",

This is a nice confirmation of David Brin's Surveillance Society hypothesis, that if much broader surveillance by government and business is, as is likely, inevitable, one of the best things we can do is provide citizens with the ability to watch back. \u00a0Interesting, here, though, is that it's not citizens with cellphones, but cops wearing always-on cameras, that provide the check on police behavior. \u00a0From the article: \"The results from the first 12 months [of the study] are striking. Even with only half of the 54 uniformed patrol officers wearing cameras at any given time, the department over all had an 88 percent decline in the number of complaints filed against officers, compared with the 12 months before the study, to 3 from 24.\" \"Rialto\u2019s police officers also used force nearly 60 percent less often \u2014 in 25 instances, compared with 61. When force was used, it was twice as likely to have been applied by the officers who weren\u2019t wearing cameras during that shift, the study found. And, lest skeptics think that the officers with cameras are selective about which encounters they record, Mr. Farrar noted that those officers who apply force while wearing a camera have always captured the incident on video.\"\ufeff",

   "content": "A Surprisingly Entertaining and Informative Hatchet Job I read Evgeny Morozov's profile of me with a kind of bemused fascination. It's well researched and captures many of my ideas, but then twists each of them in order to serve Morozov's own ends. Truth and untruth are so cleverly mixed that I'm sure that someone unfamiliar with me and my work might come away convinced that I am indeed the \"hustler\" that Morozov depicts. I suspect Morozov and I agree on many things about the Internet and its effect on society, though you'd never think so from what he's written. \u00a0We differ in our approach to ideas, though. Like Korzybski, a writer whom Morozov correctly identifies as one of the sources of my thinking, I believe that language and the ideas it reflects are a map that helps us to see the world more clearly and that can lead us to our destination or can lead us astray. Criticism is useful for any thinker. Dialogue and debate are effective ways to improve our maps. Unfortunately, Morozov's style of criticism fails precisely because it is not meant to be useful. \u00a0His disdain for engagement and discussion, his willingness to say \"I know what you think better than you do,\" \u00a0demonstrate someone with an axe to grind rather than someone who wants to find the truth.\ufeff",

   "content": "Thoughts on Digital Preservation from my 2011 talk at the Library of Congress Back in 2011, I gave a talk about digital preservation at the Library of Congress. \u00a0The LOC just made the video available now, several years later. I start out by talking about some personal failures of digital preservation. First, I discuss our failure at O'Reilly Media to keep much in the way of records of GNN, the first web portal and the first web site to offer advertising; we just didn't given enough thought at the time to the importance of what we were doing. \u00a0In 1993, we were just a small company doing something we thought was interesting; we didn't realize how historic our work would be. Later, realizing the importance, we made an attempt to keep records of the 1998 \"open source summit\" by assembling links to various published sources, only to find those sources disappear or be redirected over time. The third failure was a failure of Google Maps when I was out of range in the Sierra, coupled with the unavailability of printed maps. \u00a0This leads me to reflections on a future without print, and the urgency of thinking about digital preservation. I contrast these personal failures with the design of systems like Wikipedia and Github, which have digital preservation and version control built right in. I urge thinking about the design of systems where preservation and archiving are not afterthoughts, but essential to the service.\ufeff",

( http://simson.net/clips/99.Globe.02-18.Copyrights_and_wrongs+.shtml ) I excerpted this heavily in a 2001 piece piece focusing on one of its key points, Open Source and the Obligation to Recycle. I was asked to sign a petition to ask Google to keep it open. I suggested instead that they ask for it to be open sourced, and turned over to someone who would operate the service. \u00a0That I'd be willing to sign. Google is entirely within its rights to shut Google Reader down, but it would be an awesome move to turn it over to a community that wants to keep it alive. \u00a0(Of course, those who ask for that option may not realize the scale and cost of what they are asking for. \u00a0It isn't any longer just about source code, as I pointed out in a debate with Richard Stallman back in 1999 ( http://oreilly.com/tim/archives/mikro_age_of_infoware.pdf ), when I observed that just having the code for Google wouldn't give him Google, because it was actually a service, not just a standalone program.) \u00a0I suspect that Google has been underwriting this service at considerable cost.\ufeff",

   "content": "Can The Republicans Be Saved From Obsolescence? This is a terrific piece about the demographic, technological, and ideological divides that threaten the future of the Republican Party.\u00a0 Here are a few choice quotes, many of them from young conservatives who are dispirited by the chokehold on the Party by ideological elders. Bret Jacobsen, co-founder of Red Edge, the right's answer to Blue State Digital: \u00a0 \u201c1.25 million more young people supported Obama in 2012 over 2008.\" \"while the Romney campaign raised slightly more money from its online ads than it spent on them, Obama\u2019s team more than doubled the return on its online-ad investment.\" \"Obama was the very first candidate to appear on Reddit. We ask our clients, \u2018Do you know what Reddit is?\u2019 And only one of them did. Then we show them this photo of Obama hugging his wife with the caption \u2018Four more years\u2019 \u2014 an image no conservative likes. And we tell them, \u2018Because of the way the Obama campaign used things like Reddit, that photo is the single-most popular image ever seen on Twitter or Facebook.\u2019 Just to make sure there\u2019s plenty of salt in the wound.\u201d Then there's Patrick Ruffini: \u201cThe thing I was struck by at RootsCamp was that in many ways, the Democratic technology ecosystem has embraced the free market \u2014 whereas the Republican one sort of runs on socialism, with the R.N.C. being the overlord.\u201d \"\u201cLet me tell you something. The Hispanic voters in Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico don\u2019t give a damn about Marco Rubio, the Tea Party Cuban-American from Florida. You know what? We won the Cuban vote! And it\u2019s because younger Cubans are behaving differently than their parents. It\u2019s probably my favorite stat of the whole campaign. So this notion that Marco Rubio is going to heal their problems \u2014 it\u2019s not even sophomoric; it\u2019s juvenile!\" (OK, that one's from David Plouffe.) There's an extended description of two focus groups that young Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson held in Columbus Ohio that is full of juicy bits, but too long to reproduce here. \u00a0Just read it. Here's Ken Mehlman, who played a key role in the Bush campaign, but who left politics and came out as gay: \u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s an important book by Ben Wattenberg and Richard Scammon called \u2018The Real Majority,\u2019 published in 1970,\u201d Mehlman said as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cThe book explains in part how the Republican Party would go on to win five out of six presidential elections through the eyes of the \u2018typical\u2019 voter \u2014 a working-class couple in Dayton, Ohio. They\u2019re white, worried about crime, feel burdened by taxes and feel like too many Democrats don\u2019t understand these concerns.\u201d \"Today\u2019s typical voter, he went on to say, could be that same white couple in Dayton. \u201cBut here\u2019s the difference,\u201d he said. \u2018They worry about economic mobility \u2014 can their kids get ahead or even keep up. Their next-door neighbors are Latino whose mom gets concerned when she hears talk about self-deportation or no driver\u2019s licenses. And that couple has a gay niece and an African-American brother-in-law. And too many folks like the couple in Dayton today wonder if some of the G.O.P. understands their lives anymore.\u201d And here's Bret Jacobson again: \u201cI think the answer for a vibrant Republican Party is to make our North Star empowering every individual in this country to follow their own dream, free of legislative excesses,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are millions of Americans who take seriously their religious culture as well as traditions that have been handed down for centuries. And the party has to empower them to fight those battles in the social sphere, not in the government sphere. That\u2019s harder work than taking control of the country for four years. But it\u2019s the appropriate battle.\u201d I agree. That's a consistent vision for the Republican Party. Right now, they have a set of values that sit very uncomfortably together. \u00a0We're the party of freedom from government, except in these areas, where we're the Taliban, and we want our religious beliefs to be backed by the power of the state. Frankly, while the two party system has much to recommend it (compared to fragmented multi-party coalition governments), I'd love to see a profound redrawing of the lines, since there's a broad centrality of thought in this country that overlaps with the best of both parties, and exiles the worst of both to the fringes. \u00a0It would be great to have a real debate within the core of common sense that spans both parties.\ufeff",

   "content": "Cory Doctorow on DRM, EULAs, and the loss of control over our computers In his talk at the O'Reilly Media Tools of Change for Publishing Conference Author Day, Cory Doctorow made an impassioned attack on DRM and the creeping erosion of the idea that individuals should be in charge of the computers they use. \u00a0(Livestream is below; Cory's recorded talk will later be available online.) Here are a few choice quotes: \u00a0\"DRM changes your computer from 'What can I do for you, sir' to 'I can't let you do that, Dave.'\" \"The idea that you can make unreasonable things reasonable by just putting them in the fine print and shoving them down our throat has penetrated every level of our society.\" \u00a0 Rather than saying \"Don't do that any more,\" we say \"Don't do that any more unless you put it in the license agreement.\" (The previous two quotes were in the context of the settlement of a class action lawsuit against the Lower Merion School District for spying on their students at home via school-issued laptops. After the settlement, the school district didn't agree to stop doing it; they just changed the \"terms of use\", requiring students sign an agreement in order to specifically allow it in order to receive the laptops! \u00a0For more details on the case, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School_District \u00a0) \"The job of the artist can't ever be to be responsible for censorship and surveillance.\" \u00a0(His message: If I have to accept DRM as an author, I will have to change jobs.)\ufeff",
